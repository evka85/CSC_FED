----   1.0.0    ----
---- 2016-11-21 ----
--------------------

Initial version, probably doesn't work haha :)
Actually it turns out it does work -- the DMB/ODMB 1.6Gbs links are looking good, receiving valid IDLE words and shows no notintable or dispersion errors.
In this version there's no CSC logic, only a couple of DMB / ODMB links with ILA attached to them

--------------------
----   1.0.1    ----
---- 2016-11-22 ----
--------------------

Added clock correction and rx buffer status to the RX ILAs

--------------------
----   1.0.2    ----
---- 2016-11-23 ----
--------------------

Removed special treatment of different DMB types -- now any type of DMB is just a DMB (be it copper DMB, 1.6Gbs ODMB, future 10Gbs ODMB or even > 10Gbs multilink ODMB), DAQ module won't care -- all it will see is just a data bus of some width and a data clock for any given input
Reorganized fiber mapping magic (separated TX and RX fiber maps)

--------------------
----   1.0.3    ----
---- 2016-11-23 ----
--------------------

Ok, getting more interesting -- now that the low level stuff is taken care of and stable, we're going up the ladder of abstraction.
Added CSC_FED mother module which doesn't care in which board it's running. It currently has 3 modules:
    - TTC (clocks, commands, config, monitor)
    - System (firmware version, config params)
    - Link Monitor (DMB and spy link errors and other counters)
IPbus support support for everything, register file added and register generation script added.
No DAQ functionality yet, but that's coming shortly.

----   1.0.4    ----
---- 2016-11-23 ----
--------------------

Fix CSC logic global reset -- assert also after GTH reset is done by the system module
