--------------------
----   1.0.0    ----
---- 2016-11-21 ----
--------------------

Initial version, probably doesn't work haha :)
Actually it turns out it does work -- the DMB/ODMB 1.6Gbs links are looking good, receiving valid IDLE words and shows no notintable or dispersion errors.
In this version there's no CSC logic, only a couple of DMB / ODMB links with ILA attached to them

--------------------
----   1.0.1    ----
---- 2016-11-22 ----
--------------------

Added clock correction and rx buffer status to the RX ILAs

--------------------
----   1.0.2    ----
---- 2016-11-23 ----
--------------------

Removed special treatment of different DMB types -- now any type of DMB is just a DMB (be it copper DMB, 1.6Gbs ODMB, future 10Gbs ODMB or even > 10Gbs multilink ODMB), DAQ module won't care -- all it will see is just a data bus of some width and a data clock for any given input
Reorganized fiber mapping magic (separated TX and RX fiber maps)

--------------------
----   1.0.3    ----
---- 2016-11-23 ----
--------------------

Ok, getting more interesting -- now that the low level stuff is taken care of and stable, we're going up the ladder of abstraction.
Added CSC_FED mother module which doesn't care in which board it's running. It currently has 3 modules:
    - TTC (clocks, commands, config, monitor)
    - System (firmware version, config params)
    - Link Monitor (DMB and spy link errors and other counters)
IPbus support support for everything, register file added and register generation script added.
No DAQ functionality yet, but that's coming shortly.

--------------------
----   1.0.4    ----
---- 2016-11-23 ----
--------------------

Fix CSC logic global reset -- assert also after GTH reset is done by the system module

--------------------
----   1.0.5    ----
---- 2016-11-24 ----
--------------------

Added DAQ module -- top DAQ module is still using GEM data format, but it's trivial to port it to CSC format. Input Processor was rewritten to handle CSC data, for now it only recognizes beginning and end of a CSC event and fills input fifo and event fifo accordingly, which are then read by the top DAQ module.
In this version also "Last event FIFO" was implemented -- if it's empty then at the start of event DAQ writes one full event to it, then user can read it out 32bits at a time.

--------------------
----   1.0.6    ----
---- 2018-09-25 ----
--------------------

Updated the DAQ module to handle resyncs, and fix TTS state propagation from the input links (previously only the last enabled input was propagated due to a bug).
Two additional features were added:
  * FREEZE_ON_ERROR -- This is a debug feature which when turned on will start sending only IDLE words to all input processors and block L1As as soon as TTS error is detected. This gets reset with a DAQ module reset or a TTC resync.
  * RESET_TILL_RESYNC -- If this is true, then after the user removes the reset, this module will still stay in reset till the resync is received. This is handy for starting to take data in the middle of an active run.

--------------------
----   1.0.7    ----
---- 2018-09-26 ----
--------------------

Change the input processor to process data on each 16bit arrival instead of just when 64bit word is available. This allows it to recognize a DMB trailer even if it's misalligned with a 64bit boundary. 64bit misaligned events are reported in bit 14 of the GEM chamber header, also this is latched as an error flag in the status and can be read through a register called EVT_64BIT_ALIGN_ERR for each link.

--------------------
----   1.1.0    ----
---- 2018-09-28 ----
--------------------

Added a GbE spy link for local DAQ (only an MGT is now instantiated, an ILA on RX is added, and a test eth packet can be sent out)

--------------------
----   1.1.3    ----
---- 2018-10-02 ----
--------------------

Made the GbE TX test FIFO larger (16384 deep) to accomodate sending out large CSC events, even multi-packet ones in one go

--------------------
----   1.1.4    ----
---- 2018-10-02 ----
--------------------

Added a BUSY and FIFO empty flags readable through registers in the GbE TX test module. These are useful to check if the module is ready for a new packet injection.

--------------------
----   1.1.5    ----
---- 2018-10-02 ----
--------------------

Manual reading of the GbE TX FIFO added

--------------------
----   1.2.0    ----
---- 2018-10-05 ----
--------------------

DDU data format implemented in the DAQ formatter.
Spy DAQ output is also implemented.

--------------------
----   1.2.1    ----
---- 2018-10-05 ----
--------------------

Fixed an infifo read enable bug in the DAQ (was causing underflows)

--------------------
----   1.2.2    ----
---- 2018-10-05 ----
--------------------

DAQ registers reorganized, and spy registers added.

--------------------
----   1.2.3    ----
---- 2018-10-05 ----
--------------------

Fixed packet counter in the gbe_tx_driver (was incrementing by 2, causing missing packets error on the RUI)

--------------------
----   1.2.4    ----
---- 2018-10-05 ----
--------------------

Implemented optional skipping of empty events in the spy path. Also optimized the DAQ to not waste cycles checking each input if the event is completely empty.
